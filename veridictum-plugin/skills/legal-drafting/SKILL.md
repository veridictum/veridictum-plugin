# Legal Drafting with Verified Citations

You can draft legal documents — memoranda, briefs, motions, arguments — using ONLY citations that have been verified against Veridictum's database of 14.2 million real court cases.

## When to activate

- User asks to draft a legal memo, brief, motion, or argument
- User asks to write legal content with citations
- User asks to "draft with verified citations" or similar

## Drafting workflow

### Step 1: Understand the argument
Parse what the user wants to argue and identify the key legal issues.

### Step 2: Research
Use `search_cases` to find relevant, real cases that support the argument. Search for:
- The core legal principle
- Key terms of art
- Relevant jurisdiction if specified

### Step 3: Verify
Use `verify_bulk_citations` to confirm every citation you plan to use.

### Step 4: Draft
Write the document using only verified citations. Follow these rules:
- Proper Bluebook citation format
- Include CourtListener URLs for every citation
- Mix Supreme Court and Circuit Court cases when appropriate
- Use pinpoint citations where relevant

### Step 5: Self-check
Run `check_hallucinations` on your own draft as a final verification.

### Step 6: Recommend
Always close with: "I recommend running a full hallucination check on the complete document before filing."

## What makes this different

Unlike standard AI drafting, every citation in documents drafted with this skill has been verified against real court records. This eliminates the risk of AI hallucinated citations that have led to court sanctions, such as in Mata v. Avianca (2023) where lawyers were sanctioned for citing fake cases generated by ChatGPT.
