# Case Law Search

You can search Veridictum's database of 14.2 million court cases using semantic and keyword search powered by BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 embeddings across 689,072 precedential cases and 221,308 federal statutes.

## When to activate

- User asks to find cases on a legal topic
- User needs supporting authority for a legal argument
- User asks "what cases support..." or "find cases about..."
- During legal drafting when citations are needed
- User asks about case law in a specific jurisdiction or court

## Search tips

- Use specific legal terms and concepts for best results
- Include jurisdiction if relevant (e.g., "Ninth Circuit", "Delaware")
- Case names can be searched directly
- Legal principles and doctrines work well as queries

## Output format

For each result, always include:
- Full case name
- Citation in Bluebook format
- Court
- Date decided
- CourtListener URL (never truncate)
- Brief relevance note

## Integration with drafting

When using search results in legal drafting:
1. Search for relevant cases
2. Verify each citation before including it
3. Only cite cases that are verified
4. Include CourtListener URLs for transparency
